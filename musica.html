    <h1>No. 1 Party Anthem</h1>
    <h2>Arctic Monkeys</h2>

    <p>
        So you’re on the prowl wondering whether<br>
        She left already or not<br>
        Leather jacket, collar popped like antenna<br>
        Never knowing when to stop<br>
        Sunglasses indoors, par for the course<br>
        Lights in the floors and sweat on the walls<br>
        Cages and poles<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Call off the search for your soul<br>
        Or put it on hold again<br>
        She’s having a sly indoor smoke and<br>
        She calls the folks who run this, her oldest friends<br>
        Sipping her drink and laughing at imaginary jokes<br>
        As all the signals are sent<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Her eyes invite you to approach<br>
        And it seems as though those lumps in your throat<br>
        That you just swallowed, have got you going<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Number one party anthem<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        She’s a certified mind blower<br>
        Knowing full well that I don’t<br>
        I may suggest there’s somewhere from which I might know her<br>
        Just to get the ball to roll<br>
        Drunken monologues, confused because<br>
        It’s not like I’m falling in love<br>
        I just want you to do me no good<br>
        And you look like you could<br>
    </p>
    <p>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Number one party anthem<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Before the moment's gone<br>
        Number one party anthem<br>
        Yeah, yeah<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The look of love<br>
        The rush of blood<br>
        The she’s with me<br>
        The gallic shrug<br>
        The shutterbugs<br>
        The Camera Plus<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        The black and white and the colour dodge<br>
        The good time girls<br>
        The cubicles<br>
        The house of fun<br>
        The number one party anthem<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Come on, come on, come on<br>
        Before the moment's gone<br>
    </p>

    <p>
        Number one party anthem<br>
        Number one party anthem<br>
        Number one party anthem<br>
        Yeah, yeah.
